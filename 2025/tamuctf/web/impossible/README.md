My friends and I used to play this game all the time as kids! I never managed to win though, can you?

# solution
- we are given a flash game and we have to complete it to get the flag . this is what i think
- as the name suggests this is impossible , but this was a popular game back in the days so there are solutions to all the levels available out there . there are 110 levels . NERDS(me) CAN SOLVE THIS MANUALLY
-  i used jpexs decompiler which decompiles a flash game 
and in the source images . at the last there was 2-3 modified images one of which had the flag
