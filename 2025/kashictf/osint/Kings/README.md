# Kings - writeup

Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 4 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.

Flag Format: KashiCTF{XX.XXXX_YY.YYYY}

---

There is a given image of a dagger.

By searching for it i found that it belongs to king tutankhamun, similar type of dagger is owned by Emperor Jahangir

So what ever i found in this chall is given below -
```
ruler: jahangir
artist: Ustad Mansur 
painting: dodo
currently at: 59.939812,30.314563 (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia)
```

The flag after shifting certain decimal places found to be -  `KashiCTF{59.9399_30.3149}`
