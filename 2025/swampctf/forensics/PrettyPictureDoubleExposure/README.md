## Pretty Picture Double Exposure (Forensics)

### **Challenge:**

We were given an image and had to extract hidden data from it.

### **Solution:**

- Using **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**, the flag was hidden within the image.
- Extracted the hidden message using **stegonline**.

### **Flag:**

```
swampCTF{m3ss4g3s_0r_c0de_c4n_b3_h1dd3n_1n_1m4g3s}
```
